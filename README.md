<h1 id="top">Machine Learning: Predicting Customer Churn - Logistic Regression</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this project, we will use Logistic Regression to create a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers. The main goal is to prevent customer churn, as it is often less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones.
</p>

<h2 id="dataset">About the Dataset</h2>
<p>
We will be using a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. Each row represents one customer, and includes information such as services that each customer has signed up for, customer account information, and demographic info about customers. The key column is "Churn", which indicates whether the customer left within the last month.
</p>

<h2 id="preprocessing">Data Preprocessing and Selection</h2>
<p>
During the preprocessing stage, we select relevant features for our model, and change the target data type to integer, as required by the Scikit-learn algorithm. We also normalize the dataset.
</p>

<h2 id="modelling">Modelling</h2>
<p>
We will split our dataset into a training set and a test set, and then use Logistic Regression from the Scikit-learn package to build our model. This function implements logistic regression and can use different numerical optimizers to find parameters. The 'C' parameter in Logistic Regression denotes the inverse of regularization strength. Regularization is a technique used to solve the overfitting problem in machine learning models.
</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
<p>
The performance of our model will be evaluated using several metrics. The jaccard index measures the similarity between the predicted and actual labels. A higher Jaccard score relates to a more accurate model. We will also calculate the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balanced measure of the model's performance. A confusion matrix is used to visualize the performance of the model. The classification report generated from the confusion matrix provides a more in-depth view of the model's performance. Finally, we will use log loss for evaluation, where a smaller log loss value indicates a better model.
</p>

<h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jaccard Index: 0.7058823529411765</li>
<li>F1-Score: 0.83</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
This Logistic Regression model will allow the telecommunication company to better predict and understand customer churn, thereby facilitating strategies to improve customer retention. This can result in significant cost savings, as well as potential opportunities for revenue growth. By further refining and optimizing this model, we could enhance its predictive power and thereby increase its value to the business.
</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits to the User</h2>
<p>
The end-users, i.e., the telecommunication company can use this model to get timely predictions about customer churn. This early warning can allow them to reach out to customers before they churn, offering incentives or addressing issues that may be causing dissatisfaction. By doing so, they can turn a potential loss into a win-back situation.
</p>

<h2 id="impact">Purpose and Impact</h2>
<p>
The purpose of this model is to provide a tool that helps prevent customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Its impact could be significant, as reducing customer churn is a key aspect of maintaining profitability for businesses. This model has the potential to make a positive difference to the business bottom-line and improve overall customer satisfaction.
